<h1>Jacob's Favorite Movies!</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>One of the first anime movies I've seen and 
has a special place in my heart.
</p>

<h3>Terminator: Judgement Day</h3>
<p>A classic movie that makes you ponder if robots will take 
over someday.</p>

<h3>Atlantis Squarepantis</h3>
<p>Not technically a movie, but is a longer Spongebob
episode and makes me feel happy.
